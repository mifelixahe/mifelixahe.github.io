I am a mechanical engineer working with biological materials based in Barcelona, Spain. Throughout my research, I have been developing technologies to probe the mechanics of biology. In the future, I would like to explore emergent mechanical phenomena in cellular collectives.

I am currently finishing up my PhD dissertation on epithelial mechanics. I am supervised by Prof. Xavier Trepat at Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Prof. Marino Arroyo at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. During my PhD I developed a microfluidic device for creating three dimensional tissues.
