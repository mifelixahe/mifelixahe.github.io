#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I am a mechanical engineer working with biological materials based in Barcelona, Spain. Throughout my research, I have been developing technologies to probe the mechanics of biology. In the future, I would like to explore emergent mechanical phenomena in cellular collectives.

I am currently finishing up my PhD dissertation on epithelial mechanics. I am supervised by Prof. Xavier Trepat at Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Prof. Marino Arroyo at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya. During my PhD I developed a microfluidic device for creating three dimensional tissues.


Learn more about me by checking my CV here or blog here.

If you are interested to get in touch, please feel free to find me on internet:
